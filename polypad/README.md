# Polypad

Token launchpad on Robinhood Chain: commitment window, bonding curve, graduation to Uniswap V4.

Network: **Robinhood Chain** (chain ID 4663) · RPC `https://rpc.mainnet.chain.robinhood.com` · Explorer [https://robinhoodchain.blockscout.com](https://robinhoodchain.blockscout.com)

**Status:** Not yet externally audited.

> All deployed contracts listed below (current and legacy) are verified on [Sourcify](https://sourcify.dev). The sources in `contracts/src` match the current verified factory, launch and hook sources (creator fee cap 500 bps). The legacy set was compiled from the same code with a 200 bps cap (creation and runtime bytecode match; status "match" rather than "exact_match" because they were compiled with `bytecode_hash = none`, so there is no metadata hash to compare).

## How it works

1. **Commitment window.** Users commit to a new launch through `PolydashCommitVault`.
2. **Bonding curve.** The launch (an EIP-1167 clone of `PolydashLaunch`) trades on a bonding curve.
3. **Graduation.** The launch graduates to a Uniswap V4 pool that uses `PolydashHook`.

### Legacy contracts

The earlier factory set (creator fee cap 0–2%, 200 bps). Launches created through it stay live and are still listed on polypad.family.
