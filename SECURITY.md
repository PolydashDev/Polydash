# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open public issues for security problems. Report privately:

- Email: Jon.wier@gmail.com (subject: `[SECURITY] Polydash`)
- Telegram: [@Johhnnylaw31](https://t.me/Johhnnylaw31)
- Or a private advisory: GitHub, Security tab, "Report a vulnerability"

Include the affected contract and address, the impact, and a proof of concept (a failing Foundry test is ideal).

We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and keep you updated until resolution. Please allow reasonable time
for a fix before public disclosure.

## Bug bounty

Polydash runs a small self-hosted bug bounty for its staking contracts.

| Severity | Example impact | Reward |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | Theft or permanent freezing of staked funds or unclaimed rewards | Up to $100 |
| High | Temporary freezing of funds, or rewards paid incorrectly | Up to $50 |
| Medium | Griefing or denial of service with no direct loss of funds | Up to $25 |
| Low | Contract fails to deliver promised behavior, no funds at risk | Recognition |

**Total bounty budget: $100.** Rewards are paid in USDC or $POLYDASH at the team's choice, to the first valid
report of each issue. Severity and reward amounts are decided by the Polydash team.
