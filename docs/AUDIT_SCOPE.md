Deployed instance: StakingFactory v1 `0x0aAEa47d2e7303EC5a809062eafa59e7F011D857` (Robinhood Chain).

**In scope (verified on-chain):** StakingFactory v2 `0x904b8F5d95B593b5F4a6Dbb116b58e1d5CBe93f0`: `PolydashStakingFactoryV2.sol` and `PolydashStakingPoolV2.sol`, verified (exact match, solc 0.8.24, optimizer 200, via-IR) at [Blockscout](https://robinhoodchain.blockscout.com/address/0x904b8F5d95B593b5F4a6Dbb116b58e1d5CBe93f0?tab=contract). Source mirrored byte-for-byte in [`src/v2/`](../src/v2) (provenance, compiler settings and bytecode check in [`src/v2/README.md`](../src/v2/README.md)); tests in [`test/v2/`](../test/v2).

> **Legacy v1 factory.** StakingFactory v1 (`0x0aAEa47d2e7303EC5a809062eafa59e7F011D857`) is legacy. Its reward accumulator uses 1e18 precision, so a reward token with few decimals (for example 6-decimal USDC) streamed to a large 18-decimal stake supply can round to zero on every update and those rewards are lost. Do not create v1 pools with 6-decimal reward tokens. New pools should use StakingFactory v2.

## Out of scope

- `lib/openzeppelin-contracts` (v5.0.2) and `lib/forge-std`
- $POLYDASH token `0x319525528f42167eF7fC18b77b889958080568e4` (Clanker-deployed) and its LP
- `test/`, `script/`, off-chain apps (Polypad, Polypredict, Polytrade), front-ends

## Areas of interest

- Reward accounting correctness and rounding (`rewardPerToken`, `unallocatedRewards`, emergency forfeits)
- Fee-on-transfer handling for stake and reward tokens; same token used for stake and reward
- Guarantee that no privileged role can move staker principal
- Fee cap enforcement and immutability per pool
